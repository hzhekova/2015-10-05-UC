## The most important thing I learned at the SWC U of C Workshop was:
I learned how to use Git and it seems fun. Will use it again in not so distant future. 
Python wasn't that much fun but it's to be expected. Nevertheless, the lessons were very helpful and now I can understand better the Python scripts I have. I might even write some, who knows...
Bash is awesome. I use it occasionally for scripts. I refreshed some knowledge about pipes and stuff.
All in all - positive experience. Thank you! :)
